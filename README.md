# compSPI
Computational Single Particle Imaging

**Vision**: the finality of `compSPI` is to accelerate entry for method developers in cryoEM and other single particle imaging modalities.

## the compSPI organization

This is compSPI central repo. Satellite repos can be found in the [compSPI organization](https://github.com/compSPI):
- [ioSPI](https://github.com/compSPI/ioSPI): Methods and tools to read and write data in all formats. Also provides methods to use other SPI tools developed outside of compSPI.
- [reduceSPI](https://github.com/compSPI/reduceSPI): Dimensionality reduction methods and tools.
- [simSPI](https://github.com/compSPI/simSPI): Methods and tools for simulating SPI data.
- [reconstructSPI](https://github.com/compSPI/reconstructSPI): Reconstruction methods and tools.
